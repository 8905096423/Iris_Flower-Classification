# Iris_Flower-Classification
Developed an Iris flower classification system that utilizes various distance metrics to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project involves implementing and comparing multiple distance-based algorithms to determine their accuracy in classifying the Iris dataset.

Key Responsibilities
* Data Preprocessing: Loaded and preprocessed the Iris dataset, ensuring the data was formatted correctly for analysis and classification.
Implementation of Distance Metrics:
* Euclidean Distance: Calculated the Euclidean distance between flower samples to determine the closest species.
* Manhattan Distance: Used Manhattan distance for classification, summing the absolute differences of the features.
* Cosine Similarity: Implemented cosine similarity to measure the cosine of the angle between feature vectors.
* Mahalanobis Distance: Calculated Mahalanobis distance to account for correlations between features.
* Chi-Square Distance: Utilized chi-square distance to compare observed and expected frequencies of the features.
* Accuracy Evaluation: Tested and evaluated the accuracy of each distance metric on a sample set, comparing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to determine the most effective method.

* Language: C
* Libraries/Frameworks: Standard C libraries (math.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h)
* Tools: Text file for data storage and retrieval (iris data.txt, sample)
* Output: Displayed the accuracy of each distance metric and provided real-time classification based on user input.


Results
